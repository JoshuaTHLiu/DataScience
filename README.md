Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC, or AUC) metric. For any classifier, AUC measures the probability that a randomly chosen negative example will receive a lower score than a randomly chosen positive example, i.e. that the two will be correctly ordered. An AUC of 1.0 means that all negative/positive pairs are correctly ordered, with all negative items receiving lower scores than all positive items
